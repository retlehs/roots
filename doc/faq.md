# Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of Roots is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.

### I got 99 problems but a sidebar aint one.
